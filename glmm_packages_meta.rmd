title: "metadata for automated GLMM package list"
---

This document describes `glmm_packages.csv`, which is auto-generated by:

- regex code-golfing the list of available package names (with the pattern `"lm(m|e([^t]|$))"`)
- adding some known false negatives/subtracting some false positives
- scraping to discover the following information:
    - number of strong/weak reverse dependencies (`crandep::get_dep`)
	- eigenvalue centrality of resulting dependency graph (`igraph::eigen_centrality`)
	- download/percentile info (`packageRank::packageRank`)
- overall score is `percentile/100 + strong/max(strong) + central`

Last generated: `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %b %Y')`
